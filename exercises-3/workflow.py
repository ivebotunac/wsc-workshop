def create_travel_supervisor_workflow():

    Create the travel planning supervisor workflow with all agents and routing.
    
    This implements the Supervisor pattern from LangGraph tutorial:
    - Supervisor node routes tasks to specialized agents
    - Each agent performs domain-specific research
    - Supervisor coordinates results and determines next steps
    - Final coordinator combines all responses into travel plan
    
    Returns:
        Compiled LangGraph workflow for travel planning
        
    TODO: Implement supervisor workflow construction
    - Create StateGraph with TravelPlanState
    - Add supervisor node for routing decisions
    - Add all specialized agent nodes (weather, flight, accommodation, activities, budget)
    - Add final coordinator node for combining results
    - Add conditional edges for supervisor routing
    - Add edges from agents back to supervisor
    - Add edge from supervisor to final coordinator when done
    - Compile and return the workflow
